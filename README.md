# Towards Deeper Graph Neural Networks
This repository is an official PyTorch implementation of DAGNN in "Towards Deeper Graph Neural Networks" (KDD2020). Our implementation is mainly based on [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a geometric deep learning extension library for PyTorch.
